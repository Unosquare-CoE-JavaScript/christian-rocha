#Singleton Pattern

A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and in this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create, say, two Users in a single User application. 


##Formal Definition
    Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
