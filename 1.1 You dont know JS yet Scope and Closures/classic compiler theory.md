#Classic Compiler Theory


#Classic compiler theory basic steps:

    1. Tokenizing/Lexing:
        breaking up a string of characters into meaningful (to the language) chunks, called tokens.
        Example: 
            var a = 2;   equals to tokens: var, a, =, 2, and ;


    2. Parsing:
        taking a stream (array) of tokens and turning
        it into a tree of nested elements, which collectively
        represent the grammatical structure of the program.
        This s called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
        
        example:
            the tree for var a = 2; might start with
            a top-level node called VariableDeclaration, with a
            child node called Identifier (whose value is a), and
            another child called AssignmentExpression which itself has a child called NumericLiteral (whose value is 2)

    
    3. Code Generation

            taking an AST and turning it into executable code. This part varies greatly depending on the
            language, the platform itâ€™s targeting, and other factors.

            The JS engine takes the just described AST for var a
            = 2; and turns it into a set of machine instructions to
            actually create a variable called a (including reserving
            memory, etc.), and then store a value into a.
