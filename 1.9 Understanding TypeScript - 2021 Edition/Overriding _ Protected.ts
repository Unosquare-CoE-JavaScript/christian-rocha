/**
  Method Overriding is a process of overthrowing a method of super class by method of same name and parameters in sub class.

  Method Overriding is useful when sub class wants to modify the behavior of super class for certain tasks.


  -- Protected --
    protected implies that the method or property is accessible only internally within the class or any class that extends it but not externally.
